          "You're very nice, but I don't think we're compatible."
        </p>
        <p>
          My sixth rejection from 12 dates in three months. It's not the first time I've heard this variation -- that I'm such a nice/great guy but they want nothing to do with me.
        </p>
        <p>
          It's not the end of the world. I've been on plenty of failed dates in the last year and a half or so. Something in the neighborhood of 50. I actually feel kind of lucky to have <a>gotten</a> a response at all. Most girls, in my experience, choose to go MIA instead of confronting a stranger over text message.
        </p>
        <p>
          At this point, I can't help but wonder whether my dating strategy of being nice to and respecting women is doomed to failure. Maybe girls don't find semi-intellectual, nebishy jewish guys as endearing as they used to. Maybe the "I respect women, if you're into that sort of thing" disclaimer on all of my dating profiles is not adequately excusing me from being a sexy exciting douchebag. More broadly, I suspect that my strategy of "being myself" is doomed to failure.
        </p>
        <p>
          No big deal, I said to myself maybe 20 dates ago. I'll just do what I always do when I want to get better at something: I'll do it more! And I'll use the scientific method to isolate the effects of different variables to see what works and what doesn't!
