				<h2>About me</h2>
				<p>Hey, my name is Steve, and this is a blog I'm keeping for my stint at Dev Bootcamp. This layout is inspired by <a href="http://qz.com/" target="_blank">QZ</a>, which I talk about in my first post, and all the DBCers who posted their blogs before me. So I hope you like it! </p>

					<h3>Thoughts on Wireframes</h3>
					<h4>Reddit</h4>
					<a href="http://reddit.com/" target="_blank"><img src="../pics/reddit_wireframe.jpg"></a>
					<p>Reddit basically solves the problem of clearly presenting a lot of varying content submitted by different users at different times. Unfortunately, the final result looks a bit cluttered. They try to fit a lot of information on the same page. The left side of the page is simple enough, with each post ranked by popularity. However, this forces them to cram all the ancillary information and links on the left side of the page. 
					</p>

					<h4>Quartz</h4>
					<a href="http://qz.com/" target="_blank"><img src="../pics/QZ_wireframe.jpg"></a>
					<p>From a content standpoint, QZ streamlines the process of sifting through articles. Even though it is one of my favorite news outlets, I am not interested in reading a large chunk of their articles. The scroll bar on the left helps the user skim through all the article headlines and descriptions. The ancillary functions of the website are hidden away in a menu in the upper right hand corner
					</p>

					<h4>The Browser</h4>
					<a href="http://thebrowser.com/" target="_blank"><img src="../pics/thebrowser_wireframe.jpg"></a>
					<p>This layout is pretty standard. All of the content is relligated to the left, while everything else is placed on the right. Account and monetary-related links are placed at the top, with content suggestions listed below. Like reddit, all the action is happening on the left side of the screen. However, they make the right plane a bit smoother.
