				<h2>About me</h2>
				<p>Hey, my name is Steve, and this is a blog I'm keeping for my stint at Dev Bootcamp. This layout is inspired by <a href="http://qz.com/" target="_blank">QZ</a>, which I talk about in my first post, and all the DBCers who posted their blogs before me. So I hope you like it! </p>

					<h3>Gregorc Thinking Style</h3>
					<p>To be perfectly honest, this type of stuff strikes me as bullshit pseudoscience. Yes, everyone has a different method of learning; yes, you should try to understand how you learn best; yes, we're all special and unique snowflakes, and we're all intelligent in our own special way. But, these sorts of systems basically rip-off the Jungian Archetypes, Myers-Briggs, and astrological symbols. </p>

					<p>I think it might be more productive to identify specific strengths and weaknesses, rather than to put oneself in a box, so that's just what I'll do:</p>
					
					<h4>Strengths</h4>
					<p>Aside from the fact that all four quadrants give descriptions general enough to apply to almost everyone, I think I line-up with the Abstract Sequential box the most. I really do think I learn best when I'm working alone, but have access to experts or references. One of the things I like about DBC so far is that I have quick access to curated articles and a community of experts/students. This way, I spend more time learning, and less on searching. </p>
					
					<p>I like stimulating environments as much as the next guy, but only insofar as they aren't distracting. It really depends on the kind of work. For broad-based creative projects, stimulating is good. For more linear, structured projects, stimulation is only distracting.</p>
					
					<p>At the same time, a lot of the concrete random stuff applies to me. I like understanding the theory behind what it is I'm learning, but I think I learn the most through trial and error. I'm a big advocate of experimenting to see what works and what doesn't work. Limiting myself to only reading a book on the topic lulls me into a false sense of security. After all, the point of doing DBC over a masters program in computer science is to train myself to actually <i>do</i> stuff. </p>

					<h4>Weaknesses</h4>
					<p>While I don't have many abstract random strengths, I sure as hell have a lot of it's weaknesses. I generally find it hard to work in too-structured, authoritarian environments, especially when there isn't much room for expressing my opinions and dissatisfaction. I guess this isn't so much a weakness as it is a hard-for-me thing. I also have a hard time focusing on one thing at a time. I'm often jumping around from topic to topic, which can disrupt my line of thinking. </p>

					<p>Ironically enough, concrete sequential (another quad where I don't share many strengths) describes a lot of things I don't like. Following incomplete or unclear directions is a big one. This has been a huge source of frustration in Phase 0, especially the poorly-worded challenge directions. In these cases, I spend too much time trying to decode what I'm supposed to do. I also don't like working with unpredictable people, but who does? And while I don't like rigid, buttoned up environments, I don't like unstructured ones either. I've found that they generally distract me, and make it harder to get things done when it involves interacting with other people.</p>

					<p>Unsurprisingly, I don't like rote, repetitious, routine work. Unless I'm heavily caffeinated, listening to electronic music, and looking to feel productive while I procrastinate something else, I find it boring. </p>

					<p>Perhaps my biggest weakness (or thing-I-don't-like) is expressing my emotions. I think I often come off as cold, and my dry/sarcastic/cynical sense of humor does not go over well with some people. I haven't had much trouble so far in pairing sessions, but it might be a problem down the line when I run out of patience to actively emote myself. </p>
