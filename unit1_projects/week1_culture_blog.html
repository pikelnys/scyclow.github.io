				<h2>About me</h2>
				<p>Hey, my name is Steve, and this is a blog I'm keeping for my stint at Dev Bootcamp. This layout is inspired by <a href="http://qz.com/" target="_blank">QZ</a>, which I talk about in my first post, and all the DBCers who posted their blogs before me. So I hope you like it! </p>

					<h3>Thoughts on Shereef's Fireside Chat</h3>
					<p>From all the people I've spoken to, and according to Shereef's video, it sounds like DBC will definitely be a worthwhile experience. That said, the prospect of working 12 hour days is a bit daunting. Yeah, some of that is spent eating lunch, and doing yoga, and shooting the shit with cohort-mates, but even a conservative estimate would put me at 9 hours a day of doing solid work. Even though I currently work a 9-5 job, it doesn't sounds comparable. Including weekends, most people will probably be polishing off a good 60-70 hours of <em>real</em> work per week. Doing that for nine weeks, I wonder if I'll be able to focus adequately. Nevertheless, I've been able to go at a decent clip the last couple of days. After coming back from a business trip Thursday night, I must have completed at least 20 hours of work. And aside from some initial frustration, I've enjoyed it. </br></br>

					In terms of predictions/hopes, I think the social aspect of DBC will turn out well. It sounds like the real value added from the program is the privilege of having other motivated people around me to keep me motivated and bounce ideas off of. As an added bonus, the curriculum should cut some time off of researching what I should be learning, allowing me to focus on the actual learning itself. In other words, I'm paying $12k for the opportunity to be in the optimal environment for me to learn web development. </br></br>

					It will also be interesting to see how I interact with other cohort-mates when pair programming. There might be a bit of friction as everyone gets used to it, but it shouldn't be a long-term problem. If everyone is really on the same page, I'm sure everything will work out.
