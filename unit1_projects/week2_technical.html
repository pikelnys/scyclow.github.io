				<h2>About me</h2>
				<p>Hey, my name is Steve, and this is a tech blog I'm keeping for my stint at Dev Bootcamp. This layout is inspired by <a href="http://qz.com/" target="_blank">QZ</a>, which I talk about in my first post, and all the DBCers who posted their blogs before me. So I hope you like it! </p>

					<h3>Display: Inline and Block</h3>
					<p>Of the four questions posted on DBC's GitHub for this challenge, the difference between <em>inline</em> and <em>block</em> displays is the only one that I have not encountered before. With this in mind, I thought this would be a good research topic. Overall, it's not very difficult. </br></br>

					Some HTML elements are not well defined. The computer does not know how to treat them. When translating the code into a visual format, should the element get its own line? Should it be thrown in with a bunch of text? This is where the "display" attribute comes in!</br></br>

					Let's say you want to refer to an HTML element (ex. &#60;a>) in a styling document, and say, "hey a, I want you to take up your own line. I don't want any of those other idiot tags messing up your style...ever." In this case, you tell a to display "block". This means that &#60;a> will take up its own line. A lot of HTML elements will automatically display as blocks (divs, h1s, ps, uls, etc.). This means that if you put two 'block' elements one after the other in your code, they will show up on different lines. More specifically, it looks like the element is <em>stretched out</em> to take up the whole line. Capiche?</br></br>

					Alternatively, let's say that you want to tell &#60;p> " Hey h1, I don't think you're any better than all the other elements that hold text. In fact, I think it's downright unfair that you get your own line whan you're called. So from now on, you don't get your own line any more." In otherwords, you tell &#60;p> that it will display "inline". Normally, most things that show up within p (as, bs, is, etc.) are inline. But, as a god-like developer, you can change this quality. Neat, hu?</br></br>
