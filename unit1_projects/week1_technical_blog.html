				<h2>About me</h2>
				<p>Hey, my name is Steve, and this is a tech blog I'm keeping for my stint at Dev Bootcamp. This layout is inspired by <a href="http://qz.com/" target="_blank">QZ</a>, which I talk about in my first post, and all the DBCers who posted their blogs before me. So I hope you like it! </p>

					<h3>Thoughts on 3 Websites</h3>
					<p>Considering how much time I spend messing about on the Internet, I find it surprisingly hard to look back and determine which sites I'd consider to be my favorites. Part of the problem is that it begs the question: What criteria does a website have to meet to be one of my "favorite" sites? Is time spent on the website a good enough metric? I probably spend more time than I care to admit clicking around Facebook and Gmail, but I wouldn't say I particularly enjoy the experience. These are utilities at best, and a time-suck at worst. Similarly, I spend a lot of time on Reddit; and unlike Facebook and Gmail, I actually enjoy it. But I'm somewhat resentful as to how much of a time-suck it is, so I'm hesitant to call it a "favorite" site. It's gotten to the point where I've banned myself from even visiting it at work, else I face the potential consequences of wasting a morning/afternoon. </br></br>
					
					In any case, I have so much stuff vying for my attention that not much stands out. Most websites are pretty boilerplate, have generic content, and don't do anything particularly interesting. They might have an interesting article or two, but after that it falls flat. Overall, the Internet kind of blends together for me. </br></br>

					With this in mind (and for the purposes of answering this question instead of rambling like an idiot), I'll limit my choices to websites that actually do something interesting and unique from a website-standpoint. 
					</p>

					<h4>Reddit</h4>
					<p>Okay, even though I'm fairly resentful of reddit for stealing so much time from me, I have to give <a href="http://reddit.com/" target="_blank">reddit</a> due credit. The actual content is entirely community-driven, but the platform itself is fairly innovative for two reasons. First, the site has completely refined the process of sorting content demographically. Posts and comments liked by the mass get voted up, posts and comments disliked get voted down. Simple as that. Second, Reddit distanced itself from sites like Digg by making it easy to form "subreddits". Not only does it allow for more specialization of content, but it allows users to fine-tune their news feed, and ignore some of the larger subreddits. </br></br>

					They layout itself is fairly minimalistic (simple, basic, stripped-down, generic). I actually like this. Not only does it look like you are doing work (from a distance) while you browse the site, but it also doesn't try to do anything fancy. At the end of the day, it's just a platform. It's lowest-common-denominator. I can stare at it for hours on end and not get sick of it. It has staying-power. Maybe it's ugly, but it's also streamlined. It's not difficult to understand, either. The site has links. You click the links. Sometimes you click on an up-arrow or a down-arrow. It does what it does, and it does it well...with no frills. 
					</p>

					<h4>QZ</h4>
					<p><a href="http://qz.com/" target="_blank">Quartz</a> is a news site written by The Atlantic's business team. While most journalism comes off as extremist and attention-pandering, QZ remains relatively intelligent and balanced. They might have their fair share of entertainment-journalism and sensationalist headlines, but these are generally avoid the "BREAKING NEWS!!" game. In all, their articles are typically informative, data-driven, and focus on a variety of niche business and tech topics that I find interesting.</br></br>

					The site also really shines when it comes to their layout. The left side of the page has a scrolling list of all recent articles (headlines and summaries), while the right side displays the articles. It's a fairly stream-lined process. The navigation bar at the top allows users to filter their content. While this is unobtrusive, it's also somewhat hidden. Once I realized it was there, I liked it. I'd describe it as elegant, clean, intuitive, and stream-lined.</br></br>

					I also feel like the site does a good job of combatting over-saturation. Unlike many other websites, the list of articles does not go on endlessly. It provides a convenient breaking point for saying "Okay, I'm all caught up. That's enough for today." However, you can still find archived articles if you're so inclined.</br></br>

					I'd probably frequent the website due to the high quality of its content, but the layout makes the user experience much better. 
					</p>

					<h4>The Browser</h4>
					<p>While <a href="http://thebrowser.com/" target="_blank">The Browser</a> isn't really a blog, I tend to treat it like one. A team of editors (who I assume are doing this part-time) post the best articles and blog posts that they've found on the internet in the last 24 hours or so. These articles are generally cerebral, food-for-thought fare. They lean towards things that are exceedingly well-written and insightful. What makes this website good is really the talent of the editors to find excellent intelligent content, and their ability to summarize it. </br></br>

					To be honest, I visit this website a lot, and I've never really assessed its layout. It's pretty generic, overall. Article headlines with summaries on the left, navigation on the right. I like that the important stuff is in a darker font color, making it jump out against the white background. Meanwhile, secondary information article length, author, publication, etc.) are in a slightly lighter shade of gray. The fact that nothing particularly sticks out is a selling point, I guess. It presents the information in an optimal fashion; that is, in a way that the actual website sinks into the background, allowing the user to focus on the content. </br></br>

					I think the website has had some trouble generating revenue, which is understandable given that they don't actually <em>produce</em> any content. I have yet to actually pay them $1 a month.
