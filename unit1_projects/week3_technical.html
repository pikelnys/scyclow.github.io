				<h2>About me</h2>
				<p>Hey, my name is Steve! This is a blog that I write. It focuses on technical topics that DBC tells me to write about. I don't like what I originally wrote in this space, but the layout would look stupid if I just took everything out all together. So, this is basically a place holder.</p>

					<h3>Why is JavaScript So Popular?</h3>

					<p>The first time I looked at JavaScript code, one thing popped out at me: This language is ugly as hell. The liberal use of var statements, parentheses, brackets, and semi-colons was too much for my eye-balls to handle. Even visual basic is a bit easier on the eyes. So why the hell would anyone actually use it? </p>

					<h4>Easy to Learn</h4>

					<p>Okay, even though looking at it all day gives my corneas sores, it's actually a pretty easy language to learn. Maybe it's just because I have a bit of Python and Ruby under my belt, but I feel like I've gotten a pretty solid grasp of the language in less than a week. In particular, using JS in an object-oriented capacity is fairly simple. There aren't many bells and whistles here; if you understand hashes in Ruby and Dictionaries in Python, you can understand Objects in JavaScript. </p>

					<p>JavaScript Objects are basically just lists of key-value pairs that are accessible in either bracket or dot notation. You can store properties (numbers, strings, Booleans, other objects, etc.), or you can store methods (functions). Simple as that. </p>

					<p>One of the big differences here is that you can create objects with 'constructor functions'. In other words, you don’t declare a class to make new object templates; you essentially assign a function that creates an object, and then run that function whenever you want a new object. And then if you want to inherit from other objects, you use a weird technique called prototyping. I'm not 100% sure I understand all the intricacies of this, but here is an <a href=" http://sporto.github.io/blog/2013/02/22/a-plain-english-guide-to-javascript-prototypes/">interesting article</a> on the topic.</p>

					<h4>Already Standard</h4>

					<p>Probably the biggest reason JavaScript is the so-called linguae-franca of the web: it’s the linguae-france of the web. In other words, it's the standard because it's the standard. People use it because so many other people use it. It's got somewhat of a first-mover advantage. Because it's already king of the mountain, developers devote tons of resources to building good tools and libraries for web development. And because JavaScript has access to so many awesome tools and libraries, more people learn it. In particular, AJAX, JSON, and jQuery are tremendously popular, and make it exceedingly easier to make websites responsive. </p>

					<p>On a related note, every (most?) browser(s) support JS. This means that the code is interpreted on the client side, reducing headaches for developers. Furthermore, you can still run JS on a server with Node.js. </p>

					<p>All in all, JavaScript is a bit more fun and useful than I originally thought. It's still pretty ugly, and seems less dynamic than other languages like Python and Ruby, but is pretty useful.</p>
