				<h2>About me</h2>
				<p>Hey, my name is Steve! This is a blog that I write. It focuses on technical topics that DBC tells me to write about. I don't like what I originally wrote in this space, but the layout would look stupid if I just took everything out all together. So, this is basically a place holder.</p>

					<h3>What is Rails?</h3>
					<p>Over the last eight weeks I've learned a lot about the individual components of web development. I find it all very interesting, but putting together a cohesive project is admittedly a pain in the ass. Writing a simple applicaiton in Ruby is relatively easy, but it can be quite time consuming to make it interact with a database and front-end. Fortunately, smart people have already taken care of this problem, and have mostly streamlined the process with Ruby on Rails. It's probably not much of a stretch to say that Rails is the most popular Ruby library by a wide margin. In fact, I've heard of people who were adept at Rails without spening much time coding in pure Ruby. So, what's the deal with RoR? <p>
					<h4>Model</h4>
					<p>Rails uses something called the Model-View-Controller framework. The "Model" represents the programs business logic; in other words, it directly interacts with the database, and manipulates said data. It's in charge of the application's key functionality. It doesn't matter how pretty the app looks; if it's functionality is broken, it's not very useful. The Rails library streamlines the data interaction process by using the Active Record library. Without Active Record, developers would be forced to manually create a database using SQL, create objects in a Ruby file to represent the app's business logic, and then call data from the SQL database as necessary. However, Active Record makes sure that you can do this all in one swoop. All you have to do is create a new class that inherits from ActiveRecord::Base. </p>
					<h4>View</h4>
					<p>On the other side of things, Rails makes it easy for users to interact with the Model by using another sub-library called Action Pack. This itself is split into two sub-sub-libraries, Action View and Action Controller. Action View allows developers to dynamically interact Ruby code with HTML. This generally takes the form of an erb file, which is essentially HTML code with Ruby code embedded in it. The code document generally looks like html, but contains these tags: /<% %> with Ruby code between them. </p>
					<h4>Control</h4>
					<p>Active Controller acts as the middle man between the model and the view, and allows users to interact with the data. For example, the user will look at the app's front end (which takes data from the model), and interact with it. These interactions are logged by the controller, which subsequently changes the model accordingly. </p>
