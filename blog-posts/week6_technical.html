				<h2>About me</h2>
				<p>Hey, my name is Steve! This is a blog that I write. It focuses on technical topics that DBC tells me to write about. I don't like what I originally wrote in this space, but the layout would look stupid if I just took everything out all together. So, this is basically a place holder.</p>

					<h3>Like Mother, Like Son</h3>
					<p>When attempting to model several objects, inheritance can be useful to keep your code DRY. In the real world, living organisms carry around a set fo genetic code. When they have offspring, the child contains nearly identical genetic code. In other words, the child "inherits" traits from the parent. In Object Oriented Programming (OOP), it essentially works the same way. You create a class (the parent), which might contain some methods and attributes. Then you create a child, and tell the child to inherit from the parent. As you might expect, the child looks a lot like the parent it inherits from. In fact, if we create a Child class without telling it to do anything, it will look <em>exactly</em> like the parent. Let's take a closer look at how this works:</p>
					<script src="https://gist.github.com/scyclow/2b9610e3cc072206f82e.js"></script>
					<p> There are a few things worth examining here. </br></br> First, note that we never define parent_method1 in Child, but we can still use this method. As explained above, it's because we inherited it from the Parent class. </br></br>
					Second, notice the super() on line 19. We told the child to define @type as "child" on 18, and then basically tell it to follow the parent's lead. So when we call it on line 34, it continues with the same functionality (except with a different @type). </br></br>
					Third, we redefine parent_method2 int he child. Even though we never defined parent_method1, we can still use it on the child, and it would exhibit the same functionality as in the parent. If we left parent_method2 alone, it would do the same thing. But, we redefined it, and gave it different functionality.</br></br>
					Fourth, we defined a new method alltogether for the child, child_method, which is unique to the child. </br></br>
					Okay, so everything seems pretty chipper here. Except inheritance can get a bit tricky. If we want to change the Parent class, for instance, the child would be affected by the change.
					</p>
					<script src="https://gist.github.com/scyclow/0e31b5db267793b46427.js"></script>
					<p>Ignoring the number lines here (pretend this is the same file, and takes place after the last block of code; I still haven't gotten the hang of using gists), notice that we didn't even touch the Child class, but it is still affected by the updated Parent class. In addition, updating the Parent class affects already existing children. So if we changed parent_method1, calling it on the 'me' instance would yield a different reslult. This isn't the end of the world, but it's still important to watch out. </br></br>
					One problem with this is that Ruby does not have multiple inheritance. In other words, you can only have ONE parent, and ONE parent only. What do you do if you want to inherit methods from other classes or modules?
					</p>
					<h4>Composition</h4>
					<p>Composition achieves a similar result as inheritence, but it's a bit more versatile. If the me instance inherits from the Parent class, it cn still inherit ad-hoc methods and attributes form other classes. </p>
					<script src="https://gist.github.com/scyclow/16da3fd25bc1f869dad5.js"></script>
					<p>See? We just create a new FosterParent inside of an instance variable, and call the desired method inside of new method. Neat, eh? Like foster parent like son.</p>
