				<h2>About me</h2>
				<p>Hey, my name is Steve! This is a blog that I write. It focuses on technical topics that DBC tells me to write about. I don't like what I originally wrote in this space, but the layout would look stupid if I just took everything out all together. So, this is basically a place holder.</p>

					<h3>What's the biggest problem facing the tech world today? </h3>
					<p>Call me a cynical ludite, but I think the biggest problem in tech today is our reliance on tech.</br></br>
					Don't get me wrong. I love technology and the convenience it affords me. Every day I'm grateful that I live in 21st century America, and have access to Wikipedia, Gmail, Facebook, and Uber. In more ways than not, I think these inventions enrich my life on a day-to-day basis. But, I often find myself wondering about their hidden consequences.</br></br>
					Most obviously, I can't help but wonder how I would fare in some sort of large-scale catastrophe. If the apocalypse were to occur tomorrow, I suspect that I would be woefully unprepared. After years of modifying my habits around easily accessable software, I foresee communication, coordination, transportation, and general information transfer to be a bit of a problem. Not to mention, being a developer with a background in mutual fund analysis probably wouldn't help me much in any scenario where physical survival is a remote concern.</br></br>
					Okay, maybe outright apocalypse is a bit farfetched. But it's only a worst-case-scenario. Looking at the last ten years, there have been plenty of mini-apocalypses: Hurricane Katrina, Hurricane Sandy, and major black outs in the US alone. Elsewhere, we've seen major social upheaval, devistating earthquakes, acts of terrorism, and so forth. And looking forward, I wouldn't say these sorts of events are particularly less likely. </br></br>
					To be sure, modern technology still can still help in many of these scenarios. I'm sure plenty of survivalist nut-jobs have found ways to use their computer signal for help when zombies are trying to break down their door. But to be perfectly honest, I feel as though the average American is barely prepared for a brief internet outage.</br></br>
					Similarly, the fragility of our technological infrastructure could wreak havoc if one part of the system goes down. 20 years ago, would a major earthquake in California have as large an effect on Chicago as it would today? Probably not. Nowadays, that means Gmail/Google Drive and Netflix outages. These companies genreally have back-up servers in the middle of nowhere, but it would still be a major pain in the ass, to say the least. </br></br></br></br>
					Less obviously, I have to wonder what effect tech has on human psychology. Is sitting in front of Facebook, Reddit, and Netflix for hours on end remotely healthy? Is having my attention constantly split between Gmail, Twitter, and text messages helping my focus? Is using Uber making any more environmentally conscious? Is reading outlier news stories putting me any more in tune with the world?</br></br>
					In some cases, I'm sure the answer is yes; but in most, it probably isn't. In the last 10,000 years, human societies have had time to adapt to countless items of technology (weapons, agriculture, beer, etc.). But we've only had about seven years or so to adapt to smart phones.</br></br>
					<h4>So, what's the point?</h4>
					At the risk of coming off like a ranting pessimist, I don't think it's all bad news. The good news is that technology is incredibly flexible, and we are able to manipulate and transform it as we become more experienced developers. But as spiderman likes to say, with great power comes great responsability. There are no easy answers here, but I think that we'll generally be on the right track as long as we all remain aware of the high-level (but unlikely) and low-level (but persistent) risks of the technology we create.
