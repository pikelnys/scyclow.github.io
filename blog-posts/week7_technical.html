				<h2>About me</h2>
				<p>Hey, my name is Steve! This is a blog that I write. It focuses on technical topics that DBC tells me to write about. I don't like what I originally wrote in this space, but the layout would look stupid if I just took everything out all together. So, this is basically a place holder.</p>

					<h3>SQL Injection</h3>
					<p>At the end of the day, web apps are just tools that allow end users to interact with data in complicated ways. Developers streamline the process as much as possible behind the scenes, but there is a limit to what they can do. It usually comes to a point where users need to do some work, and give the code some information to work with. This information is often manipulated and filtered through other bits of code, and winds up as an input for a database query. But allowing users unfettered access to the database can be dangerous. Without the necessary filters, malicious users can manipulate the code in an unintended way, causing it to spit out the wrong data.
					</p>
					<p>For example, lets say you allow the user to interact with the database with minimal security precautions. If a user forgets their password, they will likely be prompted by a box to plug in their username and email address. Behind the scenes, the code might look something like this:</p>
					<p>username_input = input; sql_query = "SELECT password FROM db WHERE username = " + username_input
					</p>
					<p>If everything goes as planned, users who forget their passwords will merely type in their username, and the system will work fine. Now, let's say someone wants to be an asshole; in the user_input field they type: " xxx OR 1=1". This means that the query will turn into this:</p>

					<p>sql_query = "SELECT password FROM db WHERE username = xxx OR 1=1"</p>

					<p>The xxx is unimportant, but the 'OR 1=1' is. It will ALWAYS be true for every row in the db (because 1 always equals 1), which means that it will return passwords for all rows.</p>
					<h4>What to do</h4>
					<p>Okay, so how do we fix this? One easy way is to add a bit of nuance to the SQL query. Instead of manipulating the query directly, you can tell it that it should interpret username_input literally. In SQL-talk, you can do this using the @ symbol:</p>
					<p>sql_query = "SELECT password FROM db WHERE username = @1"; sql_query.execute(username_input)</p>
					<p>Now, username_input is passed to the query as an argument instead of a string to be added onto the end. </p>
