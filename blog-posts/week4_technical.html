				<h2>About me</h2>
				<p>Hey, my name is Steve! This is a blog that I write. It focuses on technical topics that DBC tells me to write about. I don't like what I originally wrote in this space, but the layout would look stupid if I just took everything out all together. So, this is basically a place holder.</p>

					<h3>What does Map do?</h3>
					<p>Skimming through the Ruby docs this week, one thing that stands out is the sheer number of Ruby methods. Having some background in Python, I find this somewhat overwhelming and confusing. Are all of these methods actually useful? </br></br>
					The short answer is probably a resounding no. For example, I really don't see any reason whatsoever to use Array#index over bracket syntax. In any case, Enumerable#map is one of those metods that happens to be incredibly useful, and ruby's use of blocks makes it all the more pleasent.</br></br>
					So, what is Enumerable#map? Map takes an array and a block as an input; it iterates over the array, passing each element as a variable to the block. It then spits out a new array, where each element from the original array has been transformed by the block. </br></br>
					For example, let's say you have the following array: </br></br>
					a = [0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10]</br></br>
					and you want to multiply all even numbers by 2. Using map, all you'd have to do is:</br></br>
					a.map {|x| x*2 if x.even?}</br></br>
					Simple as that. Of course, map sans exclamation point is non-destructive. In other words, it returns a new array that meets the desired criteria. In other other words, it copies the old array, and modifies the new array. If you want to <em>actually</em> modify the existing array, just use Enumerable#map!. </br></br>
					Similarly, Enumerable#collect does the exact same thing as Enumerable#map.
