				<h2>About me</h2>
				<p>Hey, my name is Steve! This is a blog that I write. It focuses on technical topics that DBC tells me to write about. I don't like what I originally wrote in this space, but the layout would look stupid if I just took everything out all together. So, this is basically a place holder.</p>

					<h3>I Ain't Got No Class</h3>
					<p>When I first started teaching myself to code, people told me to hone my skills by working on silly projects. This was back when I was learning Python, and had no idea what object-oriented programming was. At that point, I was a happy functional camper. So when I decided to make a blackjack game from scratch, the first solution that occured to me when I was modeling players was to store all of the necessary information about them in a list (i.e. an array, in Ruby-ese). Brilliant.</br></br>
					Here is my original approach to the problem:
					</p>
					<script src="https://gist.github.com/scyclow/b7216fa8affdf4e52c0d.js"></script>
					<p> If you're having trouble following it, it isn't because you don't know Python. Take out the colons, throw in some end statements, turn the parentheses into square brackets, and change the Nones to nils, and you've got yourself some running Ruby code. No, the reason you can't follow it is because this is a pretty dumb way to store information. Let's walk through this. The function creates a specified number of players, each with a designated number of chips. Each player is modeled as an array with four spaces in it; one for the value of their hand, one for the cards in their hand, one for the number of high aces, and one for the number of chips they have left. If I was smart, I would have at least created a dictionary (i.e. a hash) to house this data. That way, I wouldn't have to remember which place was supposed to be reserved for chips, and which place was for high aces. In any case, I wanted it to spit out a list of players, each with some ttributes attached to them. But what you get here is a list of lists with lists in them, and no way to tell what's going on.
					</p>
					<p>Okay. Let's see what a smarter solution would look like using classes (this time in Ruby)</p>
					<script src="https://gist.github.com/scyclow/652d8783c859c55cb2a5.js"></script>
					<p>Isn't that a lot clearer? It's a little different, but it's the same concept. This time around, we create a model of Player (a class), and explicitly assign them several attributes. These attributes (instance variables) are denoted with an '@' symbol. These are basically place holders for pieces of data. For example, setting player1 = Player.new(100), and then calling player1.deal_blackjack would mutate its @value attribute. Normally, @ value would not be accessable from the outsied, but by calling attr_accessor at the begining of the class, we tell ruby to make it accessible by calling player1.value. </br></br>
					Then we have class level attributes. These denoted by '@@'. As an example, I created a 'number of players' attribute; and each time a new player is initiated, the attribute increases by 1. Interestingly, this is applicable to the whole heirarchy of classes. For example, the Dealer class inherits most of its stuff from Player. And when a new dealer is initialized, @@num_players increases by 1. Cool stuff
