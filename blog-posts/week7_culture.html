				<h2>About me</h2>
				<p>Hey, my name is Steve! This is a blog that I write. It focuses on technical topics that DBC tells me to write about. I don't like what I originally wrote in this space, but the layout would look stupid if I just took everything out all together. So, this is basically a place holder.</p>

					<h3>Thinking about values</h3>
					<p>Maybe I started reading 1984 at too young an age, but I'm of the opinion tha tintellectual independence is one fo the most important values one can hold. It's often too easy to go with the crowd. After all, doing what everyone else does requires little thought, and it generally encounters less push-back. And to be honest, the crowd is usually right. But 'usually' can be dangerous. </p>
					<p>I'm of the opinion that intellectual honesty and independenc are two of the mos timportant values one can hold. I can rattle off several current examples of weird cultural norms that tend to go unquestioned, but here's a less vague example: The financial crisis of 2007. The issue can be dissected from any number of angles, but from an investment standpoint, those who were intellectually honest with themselves generally walked away unscathed. They looked at the data, ignored the false conclusions of the pack, and made the right bet.</p>
					<p>More abstractly, I think it's important to take this quality to other aspects of life. Social, economic, and intellectual falsehoods can persist for years, but that doesn't necessarily mean they are right. Eventually, they will break</p>
					<p>I try to hold this value in high regards, but like most human's, I'm far from perfect. On most days, I'd say I clock in above-average, maybe at a 3.5 or 4 out of 5. When I have a strong opinion about something, I can readh a 5. Unfortunately, I suspect I slip closer to 0 than I'd like when it comes to issues I'm indifferent or ill-informed about.</p>
					<h4>Advice</h4>
					<p>I generally don't like giving advice. I will never have enough information to make an informed decision in place of someone else. I'll throw in my 2c for the sake of providing a fresh outlook, but it's never very adequate, in my opinion. All I can really say is what I would do in a certain situation.</p>
					<h4>Values and Stereotype Threat</h4>
					<p>Stereotyping is somewhat inevitable. Human minds are fallible, and can only hold a limited amount of information. Stereotyping is merely a mechanism for reducing a complicated situation down to a one-line conclusion. This might has some advantages, but modern society should be aware of the potential denager. For example, "Women aren't goot at math or programming" is a stereotype that blatently hurts half of the population. It cna be difficult to combat such cultural entrenchment, but having intellectual honesty to look past this is necessary to make any sort of meaningful change.  </p>
