				<h2>About me</h2>
				<p>Hey, my name is Steve! This is a blog that I write. It focuses on technical topics that DBC tells me to write about. I don't like what I originally wrote in this space, but the layout would look stupid if I just took everything out all together. So, this is basically a place holder.</p>

					<h3>Thoughts on pair programming so far</h3>
					<p>Pairing is definitely interesting, and not something I'm used to. At my current job, the work is very solitary: I do research (by myself) and I write a report on it (by myself). I send it to someone for feedback, but they just mark up the page in Microsoft Word, and I look at the changes on my own time. </br></br>
					In contrast, pair programming is very interactive, and involves talking to other people and solving problems in real time. So far, I think there are some clear pros and cons to doing it like this. 
					</p>
					<h4>Pros</h4>
					<p>Sometimes pairing makes the problem a lot more fun. When I'm writing code by myself, it can get monotonous. Having another person to talk to breaks it up. Having the human element brings more life to the problem. It's also very helpful to have someone to bounce ideas off of. Even if they don't say much, I find it very helpful to think out loud. Explaining somethign to someone else is an excellent way to clarify one's thoughts. In addition, it's also a good way to learn techniques. Everyone has their own take on solving problems. Moreover, most people have one or two tricks that I'd never heard of before, ranging from Ruby syntax to Sublime Text hotkeys. But in my experiences, the biggest benefit is having a second pair of eyes to look at the code when it needs debugging. </p>
					<h4>Cons</h4>
					<p>To be honest, pair programming is not all butterflys and rainbows. Sometimes it can get frustrating. So far, the most frustrating thing has been pairing over the internet. Some people have much slower connections, which makes it harder to have a fluid conversation. Aside from that, I occasionally feel like having another person there is slowing me down. Espescially if it's an easy exercise that I could blow through in a few minutes by myself, it can be burdensome to actually expalain it to another person. But in a real-world coding scenario, I'm sure it would be more permisable to occasionally type something up really quick, and then have the other person look at it afterwards. </p>
					<h5>Feedback</h5>
					<p>So far, I would not say that I'm very good at giving feedback. If something specific and acctionable occurs to me, I'll make a note of it and be sure to say it. But most of the time, I'm at a loss. It also seems like most of my feedback is somewhat vague. At least no one on Socrates has deemed my feedback unkind. </p>
					<p>Most of the feedback that I've read seems fairly positive. To be honest, I haven't seen many pieces of feedback that struck me as exceptionally helpful. I think it's a good mechanism, and can occasionally yield useful insights. But, I think most of the time it is kind of neutral. </p>
