				<h2>About me</h2>
				<p>Hey, my name is Steve! This is a blog that I write. It focuses on technical topics that DBC tells me to write about. I don't like what I originally wrote in this space, but the layout would look stupid if I just took everything out all together. So, this is basically a place holder.</p>

					<h3>How to Ask Good Questions</h3>
					<p> Asking questions is hard. Most people don't know how to do this well because it admits ignorance on their part. And, we all know that people don't like to come off as ignorant. But there is nothing to be ashamed of in most situations, espescially when one is learning or picking up a new skill. Here, ignorance is not a big deal. In fact, acknowledging ignorance and the willingness to move past it as quick as possible should be encouraged. Nevertheless, questions can still be annoying if not asked properly. I've found that experts in many subjects are generally more than willing to help novices unless the questions get over-burdonsome. 
					</p>
					<h4>Clarity</h4>
					<p>The first point is to be as clear as possible. Let the person you're asking understand what, exactly, it is you're asking. Provide as much information about the question as possible. Put yourself in their shoes, and try to minimize the chance of a follow-up question on their part. Show that you've put in the slightest bit of effort, and at least make the question thoughtful. <br><br>
					Alternatively, there's nothing wrong with being generally overwhelmed. But, be clear about this. If you have a vague and general question, acknowledge it.
					</p>
					<h4>Conciseness</h4>
					<p>Don't take up people's time. If you ask an expert, they are taking time they otherwise could have spent doing something important to help you out. Again, most are willing to take out a small amount of time to help, but don't take advantage of this. be considerate, and don't ramble on for several minutes. Get to the point as fast as possible so they can answer you.</p>
					<h4>Don't ask what can be easily Googled</h4>
					<p>As a rule of thumb, if you can find the answer on Google fairly quickly, it's not worth asking. Sure, if you're in the middle of a conversation and you just throw a question out there, it's certainly permissible. But it might not be worth interrupting someone to find out a something like what the capital of Kansas is. </p>
