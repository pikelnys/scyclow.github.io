				<h2>About me</h2>
				<p>Hey, my name is Steve! This is a blog that I write. It focuses on technical topics that DBC tells me to write about. I don't like what I originally wrote in this space, but the layout would look stupid if I just took everything out all together. So, this is basically a place holder.</p>

					<h3>Stereotyping threat</h3>
					<p>As a white male, I can't pretend to understand the worst effects of stereotyping. Sure, I've experienced it minimally throughout my life, but for the most part I've been pretty privileged in that respect.  Nevertheless, I recognize it as a major social problem.</p>
					<p>A few weeks ago, many DBCers noted that the biggest cultural problem facing the tech industry was its homogeneity. There are a lot of white male programmers, in the industry, while different ethinicities and genders are the minority. Part of this might be due to outright sexism or racism on the part of hiring managers, but it's likely not the whole story. While I don't have any hard data on the subject, anecdotal (and unscientific) evidence suggests that part of the problem is due to the pool of applicants to many tech firms. But, this hardly means that white males are the only demographic capable of tech work. A seperate set of anecdotal (and, correspondingly scientific) evidence suggests, women and non-white ethnicities are certainly capable of tech work in a similar statisctical distribution.</p>
					<p>Claude Steele sheds some light on the subject, as a leading researcher in stereotyping threats. In one study, he found that women underperformed men on a complex math test...but only when they were reminde dof their gender before taking the test. Interestingly, when tested on the same subject matter without being reminded of their gender, and the conotations that surround their gender, women actually outperformed men on the test. This suggests that a lot of the gender/ethnic employment gap is due to social perception, rather than ability. </p>
					<p>Personally, I don't have much to say on the subject from the standpoint of the victim. In the past, I've volunteered with middle school students by teaching financial education, non of whom were white males. This is hardly a drop in the bucket in terms of adressing the problem, but I think I at least made a marginal difference in attacking this problem. While shifting professional responsabilities will make it hard for me to continue this in the near future, I hope to continue it at some point. In the meantime, I will remain conscious of the problem in terms of shaping other people's perceptions of themselves, and try to encourage others to do the same. </p>
