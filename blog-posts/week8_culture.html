				<h2>About me</h2>
				<p>Hey, my name is Steve! This is a blog that I write. It focuses on technical topics that DBC tells me to write about. I don't like what I originally wrote in this space, but the layout would look stupid if I just took everything out all together. So, this is basically a place holder.</p>

					<h3>The Compass of Shame</h3>
					<p><em>Note: I am choosing to not publich this publically for the sake of not slighting my former employer</em></p>
					<h4>Discuss an Emotional Conflict</h4>
					<p>At my old job as a mutual fund analyst, we had a process for rating funds. It was kind of like Pitchfork's album ratings, but geared towards financial vehicles instead fo albums. After a year of working on a similar team, my team was merged into the larger mutual fund team, and I was forced to undergo the rating committee. Frankly, I thought (and think) that a lot of the process was based on bullshit, and was epistomologically unsound, and told them as much in my first meeting. Unsurprisingly, they did not receive my criticism very well, and they complained to my manager's manager. </p>
					<h4>What was the source of the conflict?</h4>
					<p>In retrospect, I was being somewhat disrespectful. And even though I still believe I was arguing a correct point, I brought it up in a way that was somewhat hostile.</p>
					<h4>How did I handle the conflict?</h4>
					<p>Even though I almost always fall on the northern end of the compass of shame (I generally withdraw from situations), in this particular situation I was the aggrssor. I did not agree with their process, and having to be subject to it upset me. As a result, I ended up attacking them (not physically).</p>
					<h4>Did my actions make the conflict better or worse?</h4>
					<p>Worse.</p>
					<h4>If you could go back and do anything differently, would you?</h4>
					<p>Given that I had to work with these people for for roughly 18 months after that incident, I probably wouldn't have done anything to rock the boat. In retrospect, the best move would ahve been to wait until we were freinds, and then bring up the problem slowly. The being said, I think they could have reacted better to the situation, and their poor reaction to my poor reaction opened my eyes to the team's culture. </p>
					<h4>What did I learn from the experience?</h4>
					<p>There is nothing wring with giving criticism; in fact, it should be encouraged. Successful organizations are one that systematically solocit and incorporate feedback. Nevertheless, I could have done a better job presenting the feedback. Going forward, I recognize that people are not very receptive to criticism, so I should handle these sorts of situations in a more delevate manner.  </p>
